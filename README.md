## Introduction

Wine quality prediction is an interesting problem that can help winemakers and distributors improve the quality of their products. This project aims to build a machine learning model that can predict the quality of wine based on various chemical properties such as acidity, sugar content, and alcohol level.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [Wine Quality Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It includes chemical properties of red and white wines from the Vinho Verde region of Portugal and their quality ratings.

- **Red Wine:** `winequality-red.csv`

Each wine in the dataset is described by 11 chemical properties and a quality rating (from 0 to 10).

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

You can install the required packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/wine-quality-prediction.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd wine-quality-prediction
```

3. Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Preprocess the data:**

## Models

This project explores various machine learning models, including:

- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Neural Networks


## Results

The model's performance is evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The results are visualized using confusion matrices and ROC curves.
